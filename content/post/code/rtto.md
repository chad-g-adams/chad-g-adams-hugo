A directory I have been helping to build for [CSED](http://csedottawa.ca/) has officially launched!

[RiseToTheOccasion.ca](https://RiseToTheOccasion.ca) is a provincial directory of social enterprises for the event planning sector. If you're planning to put on an event in Ontario, you might like to see what's available, with over 80 enterprises currently listed.

Expanding on the product delivered by our previous project (the Ottawa directory [WeAllProfit.ca](https://WeAllProfit.ca)), the new directory adds the following enhancements:

* bilingual
* maps
* location-based searching
* administrative interface, so that individual enterprises as well as directory administrators can control content

The directory was officially launched at the *#SEUnleashed* social enterprise conference in Ottawa on November 16th. As a contributor I was invited to attend the conference. I had a great time and gained valuable insights into the social enterprise sector. I posted more about the conference [here]({{< ref "se-unleashed-2017.md" >}}).
