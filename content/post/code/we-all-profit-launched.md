A website I have been helping to build for [CSED](http://csedottawa.ca/) has officially launched!

[WeAllProfit.ca](https://WeAllProfit.ca) is a directory of social enterprises in Ottawa. A *social enterprise* is a venture which has a  mission that goes beyond profit. This can mean offering employment to vulnerable or disabled people, protecting the environment, or passing their profits on to a charitable organization. Check out the [website](https://WeAllProfit.ca) for many examples of social enterprises in Ottawa.

This website will serve customers of the social enterprise sector by gathering all the local enterprises listings in one place, where a potential customer such as yourself can discover and browse the offerings. We hope this will inspire you to shop in the social enterprise sector, and we are looking forward to adding many more enterprises as we go!
