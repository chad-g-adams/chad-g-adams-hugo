Having recently gone through the birth of our first child, the following were helpful resources that I felt worth documenting here:

# The Birth Partner

*"A Complete Guide to Childbirth for Dads, Doulas, and All Other Labor Companions"*

![The Birth Partner](/images/birthPartner.jpg)

Recommended by our midwife. By far the best reference about what goes on during labour and delivery.


# Cribsheet

![Cribsheet](/images/cribsheet.jpg)
*"A data-driven guide to better, more relaxed parenting"*

Released this year, this book takes a data-driven approach to answer all kinds of choices facing parents regarding their newborn. We liked this one for the non-judgmental tone and the evidence-based advice. The author also has another book in the same style which covers pregnancy.

# What to Expect (When You're Expecting | The First Year)

![What to Expect](/images/whatToExpect.jpg)

The quintessential classic is a great reference. I use this whenever I want to ask *"what do most people do"*. It really does cover a lot of ground.

# 24 Hour Cribside Assistance

[24 Hour Cribside Assistance](https://www.newdadmanual.ca/) is an online guide for new fathers.
