With the pandemic preventing us from attending cinemas, I "splurged" for the HBO+Movies streaming package on Crave TV and spent a whole month binging movies until the subscription expired. It was a lot of fun and I definitely got my fix.

# 5 Stars

* [Ask Dr. Ruth](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ask_dr_ruth)
* [The Hate U Give](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_hate_u_give)
* [Joker](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/joker_2019) - *excellent movie although I can understand the controversy around it glorifying violence, which is a shame because there was another message in there about mental health patients falling through the cracks due to funding cuts.. and with a few very minor tweaks that could have been the takeaway message*
* [James vs His Future Self](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/james_vs_his_future_self) - *nerdy, Canadian.. yep I'm here for this!*
* [Giant Little Ones](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/giant_little_ones) - *one of my favs so far.. found out afterwards it was also a Canadian movie*
* [Maiden](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/maiden)

# 4 Stars

* [MIB International](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/men_in_black_international) - *surprisingly quite enjoyed this, went in with zero expectations (that probably helped) but liked the general irreverent tone throughout*
* [Abominable](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/abominable_2019) (2019) - *a good choice if you're in the mood for a kids movie (and aren't we all from time to time?)*
* [The Peanut Butter Falcon](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_peanut_butter_falcon)
* [Isn't It Romantic](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/isnt_it_romantic_2019) - *a rom-com that pokes fun at rom-coms*
* [Us](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/us_2019)
* [Bohemian Rhapsody](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bohemian_rhapsody) - *Mr. Robot as Mr. Mercury*
* [Yesterday](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bohemian_rhapsody) - *lighthearted fare*

# 3 Stars

* [Blood Quantum](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_quantum) - *was super pumped for this, and it was a 5-star start but didn't sustain, I found out later the filming was 3/4 finished when they ran out of funds, I guess that might explain it.. still alright for a low budget film if you are type to enjoy zombie violence*
* [The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_immortal_life_of_henrietta_lacks)
* [Ready or Not](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ready_or_not_2019) (2019) - *would have got 4 from me if it had slanted slightly more to the humour side, but that's more of a personal style preference on my part*
* [Fast Color](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fast_color) - *liked the story but it was a tad slow paced for my tastes, wish it were 10 minutes shorter*
* [Once Upon a Time in Hollywood](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/once_upon_a_time_in_hollywood) - *definitely a few LOL moments, but unless you love Tarantino or 1960s nostalgia it's not worth 2h40m of your time*
* [The Mustang](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_mustang) - *nice animal/human connection story without falling into Disney*
* [Blinded by the Light](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blinded_by_the_light) - *if you like Springsteen I imagine you'd really like this movie*
* [Good Boys](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/good_boys_2019) - *quite a few LOLs, but I was finding it somewhat tiresome by the end*
* [Clemency](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/clemency_2019)
* [The Miseducation of Cameron Post](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_miseducation_of_cameron_post_2018)
* [Godzilla: King of Monsters](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godzilla_king_of_the_monsters_2019) - *comes as advertised, if that's what you're looking for (yes please)*
* [Stuber](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stuber) - *good one for a laugh, for when you don't want to think*

# 2 Stars

* [IT Chapter Two](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/it_chapter_two) - *chapter 1 was 5 stars for me. I really love the IT franchise and I wanted to like this too.. but can't recommend it, too repetitive especially after the first chapter.. By the end of it you'll be sick of CGI fight scenes in the sewers. The self-aware moments were the best parts but they don't save the movie. Also the gratuitous hate crime against homosexuals to open things was extremely off-putting and in this day and age should have been cut*
* [Climax](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/climax) (2018) - *the buildup had me intrigued but the roller coaster ride itself was a letdown*
* [The Art of Self-Defence](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_art_of_self_defense_2019) - *was hoping for more of a comedy*

# 1 Star

* [In Fabric](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_fabric) - *92% critics score, 48% audience score.. I side with the audience on this one*
* [Alpha](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alpha_2018) - *a visually pretty movie, but so many small touches felt unrealistic about how a prehistoric culture would have been.. maybe if you turn off your analytical brain it would be enjoyable*
