I was stirred to write a blog post after stumbling across an op-ed titled "[_Forget about Toronto, Sidewalk Labs â€“ build a smart neighbourhood in Ottawa instead_](https://obj.ca/index.php/article/op-ed-forget-about-toronto-sidewalk-labs-build-smart-neighbourhood-ottawa-instead)".

I have been following Toronto's efforts at smart city development for the past 9 months (aka the Sidewalk Labs debacle), and was alarmed to read this same group might bring their bad behaviour to Ottawa.

Sidewalk Labs' smart city in Toronto has woeful accountability (and its leaked plans are [terrifying](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/02/15/news/alphabets-sidewalk-labs-was-secretly-considering-big-plans-toronto-neighbourhood)), with high profile [resignations](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/10/20/privacy-expert-steps-down-from-advisory-role-with-sidewalk-labs.html) from [leading tech experts](https://business.financialpost.com/technology/sidewalk-labs-advisory-panel-member-saadia-muzaffar-resigns-citing-deep-dismay). And yet they continue to go forward. Explain why would anyone would want that for their city?

The op-ed author says that a data policy is necessary upfront (which I absolutely agree with) while in the same breath telling us we should "inform these businesses they could start developing a smart community in Ottawa today". Seems like a contradiction there. A public data policy must be something that is carefully debated and not rushed through. It's exactly this kind of "we'll figure it out as we go" mentality that got Toronto into trouble. It opens the door for corporate definition and interference in policy (and [gas lighting](https://medium.com/@biancawylie/sidewalk-toronto-gaslighting-toronto-residents-backfired-capacitys-built-and-power-s-shifted-77c455b150a3)).  

Learning from Toronto's failure, and with many thanks to the citizens advocating in opposition there, here is what Ottawa can and should do:

* Start working on privacy and data governance policies. Today! This needs to happen ASAP or we _will_ get bullied by corporations into rushed or inadequate policies. This needs to be carefully debated and done so in a fully transparent way.
    * Do we have any smart city policies already? I couldn't find them.
    * Laughably, Ottawa's published [Smart City 2.0 Strategy](https://documents.ottawa.ca/sites/default/files/smart_city_strategy_en.pdf) does not have a single reference to "privacy" or even "data governance" in its strategy. (Yes you read that correctly. I wish I was joking.). Really shows where the priorities are.
* Next, as a city let's first be explicit about what features we want from our smart city, and debate those features in a public setting. Not all "smart" technology is smart for society or the public as a whole. We should not give carte blanche to corporations to "disrupt" neighbourhoods however they see fit, as if breaking neighbourhoods was even a good thing.
    * Let's follow the principle of [Consult first, then procure.](http://spacing.ca/toronto/2019/02/19/did-the-sidewalk-labs-plot-just-thicken-or-is-the-story-coming-to-an-end/)


Thank you to OBJ for the balanced journalism in also including an article on the [privacy concerns](https://obj.ca/article/web-data-collected-smart-city-tech-stokes-privacy-fears) surrounding smart city development.
